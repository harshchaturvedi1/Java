### Question 2: Library Management System

**Task:**
Design a small subsystem for a library management application that includes the following features:

1. A `Book` class with attributes `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and `genre`.
2. A `Member` class that represents a library member and can borrow multiple books.
3. A `Librarian` class that can add new books to the library's collection and manage member borrowings.
4. A `FineCalculator` that calculates fines for overdue books based on the number of days overdue.

**Requirements:**

- Ensure that your design allows for easy addition of new types of genres and fine calculation rules without modifying existing code.
- Ensure that each class has a clear and single responsibility.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes where appropriate to promote flexibility and extension.
- Avoid duplicating code across classes.
- Only implement features that are necessary for the current requirements.

Provide the complete implementation of all the necessary classes.
