### Question 1: Online Shopping System

**Task:**
Design a small subsystem for an online shopping application that includes the following features:

1. A `Product` class with attributes `name`, `price`, and `category`.
2. An `Order` class that can contain multiple products and calculate the total price of the order.
3. A `Discount` mechanism that can be applied to the order to adjust the total price.
4. A `NotificationService` that sends notifications to customers about their order status.

**Requirements:**

- Ensure that your design allows for easy addition of new types of products and discounts without modifying existing code.
- Ensure that each class has a clear and single responsibility.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes where appropriate to promote flexibility and extension.
- Avoid duplicating code across classes.
- Only implement features that are necessary for the current requirements.

Provide the complete implementation of all the necessary classes.
