# Access Modifiers in Java

Access modifiers in Java are keywords used to set the accessibility or visibility of classes, methods, and variables. They control the level of access that other classes or code blocks have to the members of a class. Java provides four types of access modifiers: `public`, `protected`, `default` (package-private), and `private`.

## `public` Access Modifier

The `public` access modifier allows a class, method, or variable to be accessible from any other class or package. Classes, methods, and variables declared as `public` can be accessed by any other class in the same or different packages.

```java
public class MyClass {
    public int myVariable;
    public void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

### protected Access Modifier

- The protected access modifier allows a class, method, or variable to be accessible within the same package or by subclasses (even if they are in different packages). It is stricter than public but less restrictive than default and private.

```java
protected class MyClass {
    protected int myVariable;
    protected void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

### Default (Package-Private) Access Modifier

The default access modifier (also known as package-private) is used when no access modifier is specified. It allows a class, method, or variable to be accessible only within the same package. It is less restrictive than protected but more restrictive than public.

```java
class MyClass {
    int myVariable; // Default access modifier
    void myMethod() { // Default access modifier
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

### private Access Modifier

The private access modifier restricts access to the members of a class only. It prevents access from outside the class, including subclasses and other classes in the same package.

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int myVariable;
    private void myMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

### Access Modifier Summary

- `public` : Accessible from any class or package. -`protected`: Accessible within the same package or by subclasses (even in different packages).
  Default (Package-Private): Accessible within the same package only.
- `private`: Accessible only within the same class.

### Choosing the Right Access Modifier

- Use `public` when you want unrestricted access.
- Use `protected` when you want to allow access to subclasses and classes within the same package.
- Use `default` (package-private) when you want to restrict access to classes within the same package.
- Use `private` when you want to restrict access to within the same class only.

### Conclusion

- Access modifiers in Java provide control over the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables, allowing for encapsulation, data hiding, and modular design. By choosing the appropriate access modifier, Java developers can ensure proper encapsulation and maintainability in their code.
