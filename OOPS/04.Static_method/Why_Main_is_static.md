# Explanation of `public static void main(String[] args)`

The `public static void main(String[] args)` method is a special method in Java. It serves as the entry point for a Java program and is executed when the program is started. Below is an explanation of each part of the method signature:

## `public`

The `public` keyword indicates that the `main` method can be accessed from outside the class. It allows the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to locate and execute the method when starting the program.

## `static`

The `static` keyword means that the `main` method belongs to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class. This allows the JVM to call the method without creating an instance of the class.

## `void`

The `void` keyword indicates that the `main` method does not return any value. It simply performs some operations and does not produce any result.

## `main`

`main` is the name of the method. It's the conventional name used for the entry point method in Java programs.

## `String[] args`

The `String[] args` parameter allows the program to accept command-line arguments. When you run a Java program from the command line, you can pass arguments to it, and these arguments are stored in the `args` parameter as an array of strings.

## Example

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your program logic goes here
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
