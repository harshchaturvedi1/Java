# Ternary Operator in Java

The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to express conditional statements in Java. It is often used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements.

## Syntax

The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

```java
variable = (condition) ? expression1 : expression2;
```

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 5;

int max = (x > y) ? x : y;
System.out.println("Maximum value is: " + max);

```

```

```
