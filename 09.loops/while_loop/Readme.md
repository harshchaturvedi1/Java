# While Loop in Java

In Java, the `while` loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's useful when you want to execute a block of code iteratively until a condition becomes false.

## Syntax

```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed while the condition is true
}
```

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++; // Incrementing the value of i
}

```

```java
while (true) {
    // This loop will run indefinitely
}
```
