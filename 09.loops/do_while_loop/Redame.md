## do while loop

- In addition to the while loop, Java also provides the do-while loop, which is similar but guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked. Its syntax is as follows:

```java
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);

```

- The do-while loop checks the condition after the loop body is executed, ensuring that the loop body is executed at least once.
