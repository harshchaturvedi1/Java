# Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements in Java allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. They help you execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

## If Statement

## If else

## else if

## nested if else

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

```java
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
}
```
