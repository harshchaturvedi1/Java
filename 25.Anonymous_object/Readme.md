# Anonymous Objects in Java

In Java, an anonymous object is an object that is created without assigning it to a reference variable. Anonymous objects are useful when you need to perform a short-lived operation without the need to reuse the object later in the program.

## Usage

Anonymous objects are typically used in scenarios where a single method call or a short sequence of method calls is required.

```java
public class MyClass {
    public void displayMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println("Message: " + message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous object and invoking a method
        new MyClass().displayMessage("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

- In this example, an anonymous object of the MyClass class is created and the displayMessage method is invoked on it without assigning it to a reference variable.

### Benefits

- <b>Conciseness : </b> Anonymous objects allow for more concise and readable code, especially for short-lived operations.
- <b>Avoiding Variable Overhead: </b> Since anonymous objects are not assigned to reference variables, they avoid the overhead of declaring and managing variables.

### Use Cases

- Performing single method calls without the need for reusability.
- Passing objects as arguments to methods.
- Instantiating classes without the need for reference variables.

### Limitations

- <b>Lack of Reusability: </b> Anonymous objects cannot be reused as they are not assigned to reference variables.
  <b>Limited Scope: </b> Anonymous objects have limited scope and are typically used for short-lived operations.

### Conclusion

- Anonymous objects in Java are useful for performing short-lived operations without the need for reusability or reference variables. They provide a concise and convenient way to invoke methods or create instances of classes without explicitly declaring variables.
